about:  The pattern of how the knowledge is spread around the web. It is like an ocean. Let's together bring an order to it.
inspiration: I am a huge fan of command line interface even in 2020. The "init" is to initialize the process and "grep" is to streamline the content and provide better view. That is how initgrep was born.
techstack: This site is built using jekyll static site builder. Bootstrap and vanilla-js is used to style.
