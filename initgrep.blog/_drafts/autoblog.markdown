"# Design Patterns in MongoDB

MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database that provides flexible data modeling and scalability options. When designing a MongoDB schema, it is important to understand various design patterns that can help optimize the performance and efficiency of your application. In this post, we will explore different design patterns in MongoDB with real-world examples of an e-commerce app and discuss their advantages and disadvantages.

## 1. Embedded Data Model

The embedded data model in MongoDB allows you to store related data directly within a single document. This pattern is useful when you have one-to-one or one-to-many relationships between entities and the embedded data is not frequently updated.

### Real-world Example: Product and Reviews

Consider an e-commerce app where each `Product` can have multiple `Reviews`. Instead of creating a separate collection for `Reviews`, you can embed the review details directly within the `Product` document.

```mongosh
db.products.insertOne({
  name: \"iPhone 12\",
  price: 999,
  reviews: [
    {
      username: \"user1\",
      rating: 4,
      comment: \"Great phone!\"
    },
    {
      username: \"user2\",
      rating: 5,
      comment: \"Best phone ever!\"
    }
  ]
})
```

Advantages:
- Faster read operations as all related data is retrieved in a single document.
- No need for complex joins or additional queries.

Disadvantages:
- Increased document size if the embedded data is large.
- Updating embedded data requires updating the entire document.

## 2. Normalized Data Model

The normalized data model in MongoDB involves maintaining relationships between entities using references or ids. This pattern is suitable for many-to-many relationships or when you need to update related data independently.

### Real-world Example: Customers and Orders

In an e-commerce app, you have a `Customer` collection and an `Order` collection. Each `Order` is associated with a `Customer` using a reference.

```mongosh
db.customers.insertOne({
  _id: ObjectId(\"60c8e5a4d849d322c4844727\"),
  name: \"John Doe\"
})

db.orders.insertOne({
  customerId: ObjectId(\"60c8e5a4d849d322c4844727\"),
  total: 100,
  items: [
    { productId: ObjectId(\"60c8e5a4d849d322c4844728\"), quantity: 1 },
    { productId: ObjectId(\"60c8e5a4d849d322c4844729\"), quantity: 2 }
  ]
})
```

Advantages:
- Reduced document size and improved write performance.
- Better scalability when dealing with large amounts of data.

Disadvantages:
- Requires additional queries or joins to fetch related data.
- Complex updates involving multiple collections.

## 3. Array of Ancestors Data Model

The array of ancestors data model is useful when dealing with hierarchical data structures, such as categories or folders. It allows you to easily traverse the hierarchy and perform efficient queries.

### Real-world Example: Category Hierarchy

In an e-commerce app, you may have a hierarchy of categories. Each category can have multiple subcategories.

```sh
db.categories.insertOne({
  _id: \"electronics\",
  name: \"Electronics\",
  ancestors: []
})

db.categories.insertOne({
  _id: \"mobiles\",
  name: \"Mobiles\",
  ancestors: [\"electronics\"]
})

db.categories.insertOne({
  _id: \"smartphones\",
  name: \"Smartphones\",
  ancestors: [\"electronics\", \"mobiles\"]
})
```

Advantages:
- Easy navigation and querying of hierarchical data.
- Efficient retrieval of all descendants of a given category.

Disadvantages:
- Additional complexity in maintaining ancestor arrays during updates.
- Limited depth of hierarchy due to document size limitations.

## 4. Bucket Pattern

The bucket pattern is a design pattern used to handle large amount of data that needs to be distributed across multiple documents or collections. This pattern allows you to split data into smaller \"buckets\" based on a shard key, improving scalability and query performance.

### Real-world Example: User Data Sharding

In an e-commerce app with a large user base, you can use the bucket pattern to shard user data based on a shard key, such as username or email. This allows for efficient distribution and retrieval of user data across multiple shards.

```sh
db.createCollection(\"users\", {
  shardKey: { email: 1 }
})

db.users.insertOne({
  _id: \"user1\",
  name: \"John Doe\",
  email: \"johndoe@example.com\"
})
```

Advantages:
- Improved scalability and performance by distributing data across multiple shards.
- Efficient querying as data is localized within each shard.

Disadvantages:
- Additional complexity in managing sharded data and ensuring data consistency.
- Increased overhead due to data migration when adding or removing shards.

## Conclusion

In this post, we discussed different design patterns in MongoDB with real-world examples of an e-commerce app. We explored the advantages and disadvantages of each design pattern, helping you make informed decisions when designing your MongoDB schema. Whether you choose an embedded data model, normalized data model, array of ancestors data model, or the bucket pattern, it is important to carefully consider your application's requirements and scalability needs.

Remember, there is no one-size-fits-all solution, and the choice of design pattern depends on your specific use case. MongoDB provides the flexibility to adapt your schema as your application evolves and scales. Happy designing!
