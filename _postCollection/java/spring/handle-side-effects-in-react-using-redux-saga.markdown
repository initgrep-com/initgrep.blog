# Handle side effects in React using redux-saga

In a complex React application, managing side effects such as asynchronous data fetching, and interfacing with external APIs can be a challenging task. One solution to this problem is to use redux-saga, a library that aims to make side effects easier to manage and more efficient.

## What is redux-saga?
Redux-saga is a library for managing side effects in Redux applications. It is based on the concept of generator functions and provides a way to handle asynchronous actions using a centralized logic for side effects.

## How to implement redux-saga in React
To implement redux-saga in a React application, you first need to install the library using npm or yarn:
```sh
npm install redux-saga
```
Once installed, you can create a saga middleware and run it alongside the Redux store in your application setup. This allows you to intercept and handle actions related to side effects.

## Effect methods provided in redux-saga
Redux-saga provides several effect methods for handling different types of side effects. Here are a few of the most commonly used effect methods:

1. **takeEvery**: This effect is used to handle a specific action type by creating a non-blocking call to the specified function.
2. **takeLatest**: This effect is similar to `takeEvery`, but it handles only the latest action of a specified type while canceling any pending calls.
3. **call**: The `call` effect is used to call a function. It can be used to call asynchronous functions and wait for their resolution.

## Real-world application scenarios
To understand these effect methods better, let's consider a real-world scenario. Imagine a shopping application where users can add items to their cart and place an order. Using `takeEvery`, you can handle the action of adding an item to the cart and trigger a non-blocking call to update the cart total. On the other hand, `call` can be used to make an API request to place an order and wait for the response.

```javascript
function* addToCartSaga(action) {
  yield put({ type: 'UPDATE_CART_TOTAL', payload: action.payload });  
}

function* placeOrderSaga(action) {
  const response = yield call(api.placeOrder, action.payload);
  yield put({ type: 'ORDER_PLACED', payload: response });
}
```

## Advantages over redux-thunk
While redux-thunk is another popular middleware for managing side effects in Redux, redux-saga has several advantages. One of the key advantages is that redux-saga allows for better testing and separation of concerns. The use of generator functions makes the code easier to understand and maintain, especially for complex asynchronous logic.

With redux-saga, handling side effects in a React application becomes more scalable and intuitive, providing a powerful alternative to redux-thunk.
