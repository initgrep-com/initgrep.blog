# New Features in Java 17

Java 17, the latest release of the popular programming language, brings a host of exciting new features and enhancements. In this blog post, we will explore some of the key additions and improvements in Java 17 and provide code examples to showcase their usage.

## Sealed Classes

Sealed classes, introduced as a preview feature in Java 15, are now fully supported in Java 17. Sealed classes allow you to restrict the subclasses that can extend them, providing better control over inheritance. This feature promotes encapsulation and helps prevent unexpected subclasses from being created.

```java
public sealed class Shape permits Circle, Square, Triangle {
    // Class implementation
}

public final class Circle extends Shape {
    // Circle implementation
}

public final class Square extends Shape {
    // Square implementation
}

public final class Triangle extends Shape {
    // Triangle implementation
}
```

Sealed classes are particularly useful in scenarios where you want to define a fixed set of subclasses for a base class, such as in geometric shape hierarchies.

## Pattern Matching for Switch

Pattern matching for switch statements, introduced as a preview feature in Java 14, has been enhanced in Java 17. This feature allows you to use patterns in switch statements, making your code more concise and readable.

```java
public String processShape(Shape shape) {
    return switch (shape) {
        case Circle c -> "Processing Circle";
        case Square s -> "Processing Square";
        case Triangle t -> "Processing Triangle";
        default -> "Unknown Shape";
    };
}
```

Pattern matching for switch simplifies the code by eliminating the need for explicit type casting and repetitive instanceof checks.

## Strong Encapsulation of JDK Internals

Java 17 strengthens the encapsulation of JDK internals by introducing new access modifiers. The `--illegal-access` command-line option, which was deprecated in Java 9 and removed in Java 16, is no longer available. This change ensures better security and stability by preventing unauthorized access to internal APIs.

## Foreign Function & Memory API

Java 17 introduces the Foreign Function & Memory API, which provides a standardized way to interact with native code and memory. This API allows Java programs to call native functions directly and efficiently, opening up possibilities for improved performance and integration with native libraries.

```java
import jdk.incubator.foreign.*;

public class NativeLibraryExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Throwable {
        try (var scope = ResourceScope.newConfinedScope()) {
            var lib = LibraryLookup.ofPath("path/to/native/library.so");
            var function = lib.lookup("function_name").get();
            var result = function.invokeExact(/* arguments */);
            // Process result
        }
    }
}
```

The Foreign Function & Memory API empowers developers to bridge the gap between Java and native code seamlessly.

## Summary

Java 17 introduces several exciting new features and enhancements that enhance the language's capabilities. Sealed classes provide better control over inheritance, pattern matching for switch simplifies code, and stronger encapsulation ensures improved security. Additionally, the Foreign Function & Memory API opens up new possibilities for integrating Java with native code. Stay updated with the latest version of Java to leverage these features and enhance your development experience.
