# New Features in Java 17

Java 17, the latest release in the Java programming language, brings a range of exciting new features and enhancements. In this blog post, we will explore some of the key additions in Java 17 and provide code examples to demonstrate their usage.

## Sealed Classes

Sealed classes are a new addition to Java 17, providing a way to restrict the inheritance hierarchy of a class. By declaring a class as sealed, you can control which other classes can extend or implement it. This feature enhances encapsulation and helps prevent unexpected subclassing.

```java
public sealed class Shape permits Circle, Rectangle, Triangle {
    // Class implementation
}

public final class Circle extends Shape {
    // Circle implementation
}

public final class Rectangle extends Shape {
    // Rectangle implementation
}

public final class Triangle extends Shape {
    // Triangle implementation
}
```

## Pattern Matching

Pattern matching is another powerful addition to Java 17. It simplifies the process of extracting components from objects and performing conditional checks. With pattern matching, you can eliminate boilerplate code and make your code more concise and readable.

```java
public void processShape(Shape shape) {
    if (shape instanceof Circle c) {
        // Process Circle
    } else if (shape instanceof Rectangle r) {
        // Process Rectangle
    } else if (shape instanceof Triangle t) {
        // Process Triangle
    }
}
```

## Foreign Function & Memory API

Java 17 introduces the Foreign Function & Memory API, which enables Java programs to interoperate with native code and libraries more efficiently. This API provides a standardized way to interact with non-Java code and simplifies the process of accessing and manipulating native memory.

```java
import jdk.incubator.foreign.MemorySegment;
import jdk.incubator.foreign.MemoryAddress;

public class NativeLibrary {
    public static native int someNativeFunction(MemoryAddress address);

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MemorySegment segment = MemorySegment.allocateNative(1024);
        MemoryAddress address = segment.baseAddress();
        int result = someNativeFunction(address);
        // Process result
    }
}
```

## Stream API Improvements

Java 17 brings several enhancements to the Stream API, making it more powerful and convenient to work with streams. Some of the notable improvements include the `toList()` collector, which simplifies the process of collecting stream elements into a List, and the `iterate()` method, which allows you to iterate over a stream with a custom step function.

```java
import java.util.List;
import java.util.stream.Collectors;

public class StreamExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<Integer> numbers = List.of(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
        List<Integer> doubledNumbers = numbers.stream()
                .map(n -> n * 2)
                .collect(Collectors.toList());
        // Process doubledNumbers
    }
}
```

These are just a few of the exciting new features introduced in Java 17. By leveraging sealed classes, pattern matching, the Foreign Function & Memory API, and the Stream API improvements, you can enhance your Java development projects and write more concise and efficient code.

Stay tuned for more updates and explore the official Java 17 documentation to learn more about these features and their capabilities.
