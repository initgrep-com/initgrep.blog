# New Features in Java 17

Java 17, the latest version of the popular programming language, brings a host of exciting new features and enhancements. In this blog post, we will explore some of the key additions in Java 17 and provide code examples to demonstrate their usage.

## Pattern Matching

One of the most anticipated features in Java 17 is pattern matching. Pattern matching allows for concise and expressive code when working with conditional statements. Let's take a look at an example:

```java
if (obj instanceof String str) {
    System.out.println(str.length());
}
```

In the above code snippet, the `instanceof` operator is used along with a pattern variable `str`. This pattern matching feature eliminates the need for explicit casting and provides a more streamlined way of working with objects.

## Sealed Classes

Another exciting addition in Java 17 is sealed classes. Sealed classes restrict the inheritance hierarchy of a class, allowing only a predefined set of subclasses. This helps in creating more robust and maintainable code. Here's an example:

```java
public sealed class Shape permits Circle, Rectangle, Triangle {
    // Class implementation
}

final class Circle extends Shape {
    // Circle implementation
}

final class Rectangle extends Shape {
    // Rectangle implementation
}

final class Triangle extends Shape {
    // Triangle implementation
}
```

In the above code snippet, the `Shape` class is defined as sealed, and it permits only the subclasses `Circle`, `Rectangle`, and `Triangle`. This ensures that no other classes can extend `Shape`, providing better control over the inheritance hierarchy.

## Switch Expressions Enhancements

Java 17 introduces enhancements to switch expressions, making them more powerful and flexible. Now, switch expressions can be used as a statement, allowing for more concise code. Here's an example:

```java
int day = 3;

String dayName = switch (day) {
    case 1 -> "Monday";
    case 2 -> "Tuesday";
    case 3 -> "Wednesday";
    case 4 -> "Thursday";
    case 5 -> "Friday";
    default -> "Invalid day";
};

System.out.println(dayName);
```

In the above code snippet, the switch expression is used to assign the corresponding day name based on the value of the `day` variable. The new syntax with arrow (`->`) makes switch expressions more concise and readable.

## Conclusion

Java 17 brings several exciting new features and enhancements that can greatly improve your Java programming experience. Pattern matching, sealed classes, and switch expression enhancements are just a few of the additions that make Java 17 a significant release. Explore these features further and leverage their power in your projects!
