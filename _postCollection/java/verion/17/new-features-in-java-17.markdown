# New Features in Java 17

Java 17, the latest release of the Java programming language, brings a host of new features and enhancements that improve developer productivity, code readability, and performance. In this blog post, we will explore some of the notable new features introduced in Java 17 and discuss their benefits through code examples.

## Pattern Matching for Switch

Java 17 introduces significant improvements to switch expressions through pattern matching. Pattern matching allows us to combine the switch statement with pattern matching to write more concise and readable code. Consider the following example:

```java
public String getColor(int number) {
    return switch (number) {
        case 1 -> "Red";
        case 2 -> "Blue";
        case 3 -> "Green";
        default -> "Unknown";
    };
}
```

In the above code snippet, we can see how pattern matching is used to switch on the value of `number` and return the corresponding color. This simplifies the code and makes it more expressive.

## Sealed Classes

Sealed classes, introduced in Java 17, allow us to explicitly specify which classes can be subtypes of a given class. This provides better control over the class hierarchy and makes it easier to understand and maintain the code. Let's consider an example:

```java
public sealed class Shape permits Circle, Rectangle, Square {
    // class definition
}

public final class Circle extends Shape {
    // class definition
}

public final class Rectangle extends Shape {
    // class definition
}

public final class Square extends Shape {
    // class definition
}
```

In the above code, the `Shape` class is declared as sealed, and it permits the classes `Circle`, `Rectangle`, and `Square` to be subtypes. This prevents other classes from extending or implementing `Shape`, providing better encapsulation and control over the class hierarchy.

## Strong Encapsulation for JDK Internals

In Java 17, strong encapsulation is now applied to JDK internals, meaning that certain internal APIs and classes are no longer accessible for general use. This ensures that developers do not depend on undocumented JDK internals and promotes better code maintainability and compatibility.

## Sealed Interface

Java 17 introduces support for sealed interfaces, similar to sealed classes. Sealed interfaces allow us to explicitly specify which classes can implement a given interface. This introduces better control over code, its dependencies, and improves maintainability. Here's an example:

```java
public sealed interface Animal permits Cat, Dog {
    void makeSound();
}

public final class Cat implements Animal {
    public void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Meow");
    }
}

public final class Dog implements Animal {
    public void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Woof");
    }
}
```

In the above code, the `Animal` interface is declared as sealed and permits only the `Cat` and `Dog` classes to implement it. This restricts other classes from implementing `Animal`, ensuring better encapsulation and control over the interface implementation.

## Stream API Changes

Java 17 brings several enhancements to the Stream API, making it more powerful and efficient. Some of the notable changes include:

- `iterate()` method enhancements: The `iterate()` method now offers a new overload that allows specifying a predicate to control the iteration termination, resulting in more flexible stream generation.
- `mapMulti()` method: The new `mapMulti()` method allows for conditional or multiple mappings to be applied within a single stream pipeline, reducing the need for intermediate collections.

## Conclusion

Java 17 introduces several new features and enhancements that improve developer productivity, code clarity, and performance. In this blog post, we explored pattern matching for switch, sealed classes and interfaces, strong encapsulation for JDK internals, and Stream API changes. These features provide developers with more expressive code, better control over class hierarchies, and improvements in code maintainability and compatibility.

As always, it is recommended to keep your software up to date with the latest version of Java to take advantage of these new features and benefits they bring to your codebase. Happy coding with Java 17!
