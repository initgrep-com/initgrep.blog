# New Features in Java 17

Java 17, the latest version of the popular programming language, brings several exciting new features and enhancements that aim to improve developer productivity and enhance the overall Java experience. In this blog post, we will explore some of the most notable additions in Java 17 and provide code examples to demonstrate their usage in various scenarios.

## 1. Sealed Classes

Sealed classes allow you to define a limited set of subclasses that can extend or implement them. This feature enables better control over class hierarchies and helps prevent unauthorized subclassing. To declare a sealed class, you can use the `sealed` keyword in the class declaration and specify the permitted subclasses using the `permits` keyword.

Here's an example:

```java
public sealed class Shape permits Circle, Rectangle {

    // sealed class implementation

}

final class Circle extends Shape {

    // subclass implementation

}

final class Rectangle extends Shape {

    // subclass implementation

}
```

In this scenario, the `Shape` class is sealed and only allows `Circle` and `Rectangle` as its subclasses. Any other attempt to extend `Shape` will result in a compilation error.

## 2. Pattern Matching for `switch` Statements (Preview)

Pattern matching for `switch` statements is another exciting addition in Java 17, although it is still a preview feature. It simplifies writing `switch` expressions by allowing pattern matching directly in the `switch` statement. This eliminates the need for repetitive casting and type-checking code blocks.

Consider the following example:

```java
public String processShape(Shape shape) {
    String result = "";
    switch (shape) {
        case Circle c -> result = "Circle: " + c.getRadius();
        case Rectangle r -> result = "Rectangle: " + r.getLength() + "x" + r.getWidth();
        default -> result = "Unknown shape";
    }
    return result;
}
```

In this code, instead of using `if` conditions to check the type of `shape` and cast it to the specific subclass, we can directly pattern match using the `case` keyword. The result is cleaner and more concise code.

## 3. Sealed and Records Combination

Java 17 allows combining the new sealed classes with record classes, introduced in Java 14. This combination brings additional benefits by providing a concise way to create immutable classes with a limited set of subclasses.

Here's an example:

```java
public sealed interface Animal permits Dog, Cat {

    // sealed interface with permitted subclasses

}

record Dog(String name) implements Animal {}

record Cat(String name) implements Animal {}
```

In this scenario, the `Animal` interface is sealed, and we define two record classes, `Dog` and `Cat`, as permitted subclasses. The `record` keyword automatically generates compact implementations of these classes with built-in immutability and value-based equality.

## 4. Strongly Encapsulated JDK Internals

Java 17 continues the ongoing efforts to strongly encapsulate internal APIs by default, which began in Java 9. This ensures that developers no longer rely on undocumented and unstable features, improving the long-term maintainability and security of Java applications.

However, developers may still access these internal APIs using certain command-line options, but it is generally recommended to avoid or migrate away from them unless absolutely necessary.

## 5. Deprecating and Removing Outdated Features

Java 17 deprecates several outdated features, marking them as candidates for removal in future versions. These include features like Applet API, RMI Activation system, and Security Manager. Developers should plan to migrate away from these deprecated features and adopt alternative solutions to avoid compatibility issues in future Java releases.

## Conclusion

Java 17 introduces several exciting features and enhancements to the language. Examples include sealed classes, pattern matching for `switch` statements, the combination of sealed and record classes, the ongoing strong encapsulation of JDK internals, and deprecation of outdated features. These new additions aim to improve developer productivity, enhance code readability, and strengthen the security of Java applications.

Java developers can take advantage of these new features and gradually migrate their codebases to leverage the latest advancements in the language. Stay up to date with Java's evolving ecosystem to make the most of these powerful enhancements to your software development projects.
