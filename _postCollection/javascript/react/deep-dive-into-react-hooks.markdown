# Deep Dive into React Hooks

React Hooks are a powerful feature introduced in React 16.8 that allows you to use state and other React features without writing a class. In this blog post, we will explore the concept of hooks, including inbuilt hooks, custom hooks, and their advantages.

## What are React Hooks?

Hooks are functions that let you use React state and lifecycle features from functional components. They are a way to reuse stateful logic between components without the need for class components.

## Inbuilt Hooks

React provides several inbuilt hooks that cover common use cases. Let's take a look at a few of them:

### useState

The `useState` hook allows you to add state to your functional components. It returns a stateful value and a function to update that value.

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### useEffect

The `useEffect` hook is used to perform side effects in functional components. It takes a function and runs it after every render.

```javascript
import React, { useEffect } from 'react';

function Example() {
  useEffect(() => {
    console.log('Component rendered');
  });

  return <p>Example Component</p>;
}
```

## Custom Hooks

Custom hooks are JavaScript functions that start with the word `use`. They can call other hooks if needed. Custom hooks allow you to reuse logic across multiple components.

```javascript
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function useDocumentTitle(title) {
  useEffect(() => {
    document.title = title;
  }, [title]);
}

function Example() {
  useDocumentTitle('Custom Hook Example');

  return <p>Example Component</p>;
}
```

## Advantages of React Hooks

React Hooks offer several advantages over class components:

- **Simpler Code**: Hooks allow you to write simpler and cleaner code by removing the need for class components and lifecycle methods.
- **Reusability**: Custom hooks enable you to reuse logic across multiple components, making your code more modular and maintainable.
- **Improved Performance**: Hooks can optimize the performance of your application by allowing you to control when and how components re-render.

In conclusion, React Hooks are a powerful addition to the React ecosystem that simplify state management and lifecycle handling in functional components. They provide a more intuitive and efficient way to build React applications.
