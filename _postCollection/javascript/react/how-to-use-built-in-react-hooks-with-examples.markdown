# How to Use Built-in React Hooks with Examples

React hooks are a powerful feature introduced in React 16.8 that allows developers to use state and other React features without writing a class. In this blog post, we will explore various built-in React hooks and provide code examples to better understand how to use them.

## State Hooks

State hooks allow you to declare state variables in functional components. Let's consider a simple example where we use a state hook to manage a counter:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```
...

## Performance Hooks

Performance hooks help optimize rendering performance. One commonly used performance hook is `useMemo`, which memoizes expensive calculations. For example:

```jsx
import React, { useMemo } from 'react';

function ExpensiveComponent() {
  // Expensive calculation
  const calculateExpensiveValue = () => {
    // ...
  };

  const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => calculateExpensiveValue(), []);

  return <div>{memoizedValue}</div>;
}
```
...

## Resource Hooks

Resource hooks provide a way to manage and interact with external resources. `useFetch` is a custom resource hook that simplifies fetching data from an API. Here's an example:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import useFetch from 'use-fetch';

function ResourceComponent() {
  const { data, loading, error } = useFetch('https://api.example.com/data');

  if (loading) {
    return <div>Loading...</div>;
  }

  return (
    <div>
      {data ? (
        <ul>
          {data.map((item) => (
            <li key={item.id}>{item.name}</li>
          ))}
        </ul>
      ) : (
        <div>No data available</div>
      )}

      {error && <div>Error: {error.message}</div>}
    </div>
  );
}
```
...

These were just a few examples of how you can use built-in React hooks in your applications. By leveraging state hooks, context hooks, ref hooks, effect hooks, performance hooks, and resource hooks, you can build more efficient and modular React components.

Please note that these hooks have specific usage scenarios and edge cases. Make sure to read the React documentation to fully understand their principles and recommended best practices.
