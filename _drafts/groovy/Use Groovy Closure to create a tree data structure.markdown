> As per [Apache groovy Documentation](http://groovy-lang.org/), "Groovy is a powerful, optionally typed and dynamic language, with static-typing and static compilation capabilities, for the Java platform aimed at improving developer productivity thanks to a concise, familiar and easy to learn syntax. It integrates smoothly with any Java program, and immediately delivers to your application powerful features, including scripting capabilities, Domain-Specific Language authoring, runtime and compile-time meta-programming and functional programming."

I recently started using Groovy. Part of my job is heavily dependent on creating a tree structure based on a data table with each row having a relationship with other row. i.e `id` of one row will be equal to `parent_id` of other row.

Groovy has this amazing feature called `closures`. As a simple form, `closures` look like
```groovy
 def closureName = { param1, param2 ->
  println param1
  println param2
 }
```

Let's say, we have a closure nested inside another closure. you can call a top level using `Delegation strategy`. `owner` corresponds to the enclosing object where the closure is defined, which may be either a class or a closure.

{% include ads/article-ads.html %}
For example:

```groovy

//top level closure -- (1)
def closureName = { hetorgenousArray ->
      
      /**java.util.List contains each(Closure closure) method 
      * which takes closure as    parameter
      * this is our inner closure --(2)
      **/
      hetorgenousArray.each{ item->
        if(item instanceof java.util.ArrayList){
          //call the top level closure
          owner.call(item)
       }
       else println item
      
      }
      
 }
//heterogenous array.contains Integer and array of integers as its elements
def heteroArray = [1,2,[11,22,33,[111,222,333]],4,5]

//call the closure on this array
closureName heteroArray
```
{% include ads/article-ads.html %}

The output of the above code is

```console
1
2
11
22
33
111
222
333
4
5


```


Referring to the code above, it becomes pretty easy to call a top level enclosing closure `(1)` with in a nested inner closure `(2)`.

Except `Owner`, Groovy closures also contain Other Delegation strategy. you can check [Offical Groovy Documentation for closure](http://groovy-lang.org/closures.html#_delegation_strategy) for a detailed explaination.
