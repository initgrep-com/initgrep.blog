# Design Patterns in Java: A Guide to Improving Your Ecommerce App

Design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems that arise during software development. They provide a structured approach to solve design issues and promote code reuse, maintainability, and flexibility. In this article, we will explore some popular design patterns in Java and discuss how they can be applied to enhance an ecommerce application. 

## 1. Singleton Pattern

The Singleton pattern ensures that only one instance of a class is created and provides a global point of access to it. This pattern is useful when we need to maintain a single instance of a resource or when we want to control the number of instances created.

In an ecommerce app, we can use the Singleton pattern to manage a global shopping cart. Let's see an example:

```java
public class ShoppingCart {
    private static ShoppingCart instance;
    
    private ShoppingCart() {
        // Private constructor to prevent instantiation.
    }
    
    public static ShoppingCart getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new ShoppingCart();
        }
        return instance;
    }
    
    // Other methods for adding, removing, and managing cart items.
}
```

Advantages:
- Guarantees a single instance.
- Provides a global access point.

Disadvantages:
- Difficult to unit test due to the global state.
- Can lead to increased coupling in the codebase.

## 2. Factory Pattern

The Factory pattern provides an interface for creating objects, but allows subclasses to decide which class to instantiate. This pattern separates the client code from the object creation logic, making it easier to add new product types without modifying existing code.

In our ecommerce app, we can use the Factory pattern to create different types of payment methods. Let's take a look:

```java
public interface PaymentMethod {
    void processPayment(double amount);
}

public class CreditCardPayment implements PaymentMethod {
    public void processPayment(double amount) {
        // Implementation for credit card payment.
    }
}

public class PayPalPayment implements PaymentMethod {
    public void processPayment(double amount) {
        // Implementation for PayPal payment.
    }
}

public class PaymentMethodFactory {
    public PaymentMethod createPaymentMethod(String type) {
        if ("creditCard".equalsIgnoreCase(type)) {
            return new CreditCardPayment();
        } else if ("paypal".equalsIgnoreCase(type)) {
            return new PayPalPayment();
        }
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid payment method type: " + type);
    }
}
```

Advantages:
- Decouples object creation logic from client code.
- Allows for easy addition of new product types.

Disadvantages:
- Requires creating new subclasses for different product types.
- Can lead to a large number of classes if there are many product types.

## 3. Observer Pattern

The Observer pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects. When the state of one object changes, all dependent objects are notified and updated automatically. This pattern is useful when there is a need for loose coupling between objects.

In our ecommerce app, we can use the Observer pattern to handle notifications for order updates. Let's see an example:

```java
public interface OrderObserver {
    void update(Order order);
}

public class EmailNotification implements OrderObserver {
    public void update(Order order) {
        // Implementation to send email notification.
    }
}

public class SMSNotification implements OrderObserver {
    public void update(Order order) {
        // Implementation to send SMS notification.
    }
}

public class Order {
    private List<OrderObserver> observers = new ArrayList<>();
    
    public void attach(OrderObserver observer) {
        observers.add(observer);
    }
    
    public void detach(OrderObserver observer) {
        observers.remove(observer);
    }
    
    public void updateStatus() {
        // Update order status logic here.
        notifyObservers();
    }
    
    private void notifyObservers() {
        for (OrderObserver observer : observers) {
            observer.update(this);
        }
    }
}
```

Advantages:
- Supports loose coupling between objects.
- Makes it easy to add new observers.

Disadvantages:
- The order of notifications can be non-deterministic.
- Overuse of this pattern can lead to performance issues.
